# Metal_spiral_stair_calculator
Program in C# to calculate the necessary materials for a spiral staircase,with diameter and height provided by the user (only the central pillar calculator so far)

Unfortunately this program is not yet functional.

- For testing purposes, the "Anuleaza" and "Calculeaza spirala" buttons have been linked to execute different things,this will of course be changed in the final version but you can have a look at the code

- The path to the excel files where the prices and specific weights for materials is read is given in the code at the moment,in the final version the user will be able to write/paste a filepath in a Textbox on the form
